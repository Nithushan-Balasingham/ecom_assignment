# Project Setup

## Frontend


To install dependencies and start the application, run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
type in vscode terminal npm i -> npm run start

- First, register an account.  
- After registering, you will be redirected to the login page.  
- Once logged in, you can view the product list and add items to the cart.  
- Authentication details and product data are stored in **localStorage** to ensure the shopping cart and user    authentication state persist across page reloads.  
- Clicking "Log Out" will clear all authentication details and remove all items from the cart.  



Notes


- Used tailwindcss to design responsive pages.  
- Used formik and yup for validation
